  "Bot: Do you have a diagnosis of diabetes or consistently high blood sugar levels?",
  "User: I actually do",
  "Bot: Do you take any medications known to cause neuropathy, such as chemotherapy agents or high‑dose statins?",
  "User: No, actually, it usually happens when I sit on the commode for too long or sleep in a wrong position, in which case maybe blood flow stops and I get really sharp needle sensations in my feet!",
  "Bot: Do you notice any pallor or bluish discoloration of your feet when the needle‑like sensations occur?",
  "User: No, actually, it usually happens when I sit on the commode for too long or sleep in a wrong position, in which case maybe blood flow stops and I get really sharp needle sensations in my feet!",
  "Bot: Is the tingling sensation primarily located on the inner side of the ankle and foot?",
  "User: No, actually, it usually happens when I sit on the commode for too long or sleep in a wrong position, in which case maybe blood flow stops and I get really sharp needle sensations in my feet!",

  "Bot: Do you have a fever?",
  "User: yes maybe",
  "Bot: Do you have neck stiffness or increased sensitivity to light?",
  "User: yeah",
  "Bot: Did the headache start suddenly and feel like the worst headache of your life?",
  "User: I am experiencing headache and fever with extreme sensitivity from light",
  "Bot: Do you have neck stiffness?",
  "User: yes",
  "Bot: Do you describe the headache as a sudden “thunderclap” that reached its worst intensity within minutes?",
  "User: yes",
  "Bot: **Urgent evaluation needed** – go to the nearest emergency department immediately.\n\n**Tests to distinguish the possibilities**\n1. **Non‑contrast head CT** (within minutes) – detects acute subarachnoid hemorrhage or large brain abscess.\n2. **CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography** – if CT is negative, evaluates for aneurysm or vascular malformation causing SAH.\n3. **Lumbar puncture** (after CT rules out mass effect) – CSF analysis for cell count, glucose, protein, Gram stain, culture, PCR for viral pathogens.\n4. **CBC with differential & blood cultures** – supports bacterial infection.\n5. **MRI brain with contrast** (if CT/LP inconclusive) – better for early brain abscess or encephalitis.\n\n**Interim recommendations & red‑flags**\n- **Call emergency services (911)** now; do not drive yourself.\n- Keep the head elevated 30°, avoid straining or Valsalva maneuvers.\n- Monitor for worsening mental status, new seizures, vomiting, or loss of consciousness – if any occur, seek immediate help.\n- Do not take any NSAIDs or anticoagulants before evaluation unless prescribed.\n- Bring a list of current medications, allergies, and recent infections (e.g., sinus, respiratory).\n\n**What to expect in the ED**\n- Rapid neuro‑imaging, possible neurosurgical consult if SAH is found.\n- Empiric intravenous antibiotics and dexamethasone if bacterial meningitis is suspected, pending cultures.\n- Antiviral therapy (e.g., acyclovir) if viral encephalitis/meningitis is a concern.\n\nPrompt evaluation is critical because subarachnoid hemorrhage and bacterial meningitis are life‑threatening emergencies.",

  "User: yes",
  "Bot: **Urgent action:** Call emergency services (911) or go to the nearest emergency department immediately. This presentation is a medical emergency.\n\n**Immediate evaluations in the ED**\n1. **Non‑contrast head CT** – first‑line to detect acute subarachnoid hemorrhage or large mass/abscess.\n2. **If CT is negative and SAH is still suspected:** CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography to look for aneurysm or vascular malformation.\n3. **Lumbar puncture** (after CT rules out mass effect) – CSF analysis for cell count, glucose, protein, Gram stain, culture, PCR for viral pathogens (e.g., HSV, enterovirus) and for xanthochromia (SAH).\n4. **CBC with differential, blood cultures, CRP/ESR** – assess for bacterial infection and inflammation.\n5. **MRI brain with contrast** (if CT/LP inconclusive) – better for early brain tumor, abscess, or encephalitis.\n6. **COVID‑19 PCR or rapid antigen test** – if respiratory symptoms or exposure history.\n\n**Specialists to involve**\n- **Neurology** (assessment of SAH, meningitis, tumor)\n- **Neurosurgery** (if SAH or mass lesion identified)\n- **Infectious disease** (if meningitis/encephalitis confirmed)\n- **Emergency medicine** (initial stabilization)\n\n**Interim care while awaiting transport**\n- Keep head elevated ~30°, avoid straining or Valsalva maneuvers.\n- Do **not** take NSAIDs, aspirin, anticoagulants, or any new medications unless prescribed.\n- Monitor for worsening mental status, new seizures, vomiting, focal weakness, or loss of consciousness – if any occur, call 911 again.\n- Bring a list of current medications, allergies, recent infections or vaccinations.\n\n**Red‑flag signs that require immediate re‑evaluation**\n- Sudden loss of consciousness or seizures\n- New focal neurological deficits (weakness, speech changes, vision loss)\n- Persistent vomiting or severe nausea unrelieved by anti‑emetics\n- Rapidly worsening headache or change in character\n- High fever (>39 °C) or rapid deterioration in mental status\n\nPrompt evaluation is critical because both subarachnoid hemorrhage and bacterial meningitis can be rapidly fatal if untreated."
